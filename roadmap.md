# ROADMAP AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
I plan to make Truerandom.js the goto module for generating random numbers or in general 'randomness'. Featuring efficienet generation, clean fallbacks, informative error handling, rich functions as well as some other useful crypto or randomness functions.

## Why TrueRandom.js ?
Because the method of generating random numbers now which is mostly the famous Math.random() function, is far from random and The other popular random library used these days is dependant on atmospheric noises and is merely chaotic. While unleashing the power of quantum randomness('fluctuations'), very gratefully provided by the Australian National University. TrueRandom.js provides, numbers which are regarded as truly random and can make music shuffles, lottery draws, in app lucky gifts, random matchmaking, digital coin tossing and dice rolls meaningful.

## How is the current development?
Currently the development is at an super beta stage, and far from mvp. Some essential functions are working as intended but are full of minor bugs which might be triggred.The library has not been properly tested,neither used in making anything meaningful as of now.

## What next?

I am planning to focus to add these things for the near future:-
- All Math.random() equivalent functions.
- Smooth fallbacks when offline
- A number of other functions, which support generation unique hashes,and passwords
- Creating tutorials for usage
- Updating the docs
- Make  it available for front end use.
- Make the code more readable
- reduce code size
- Improving performance
- Writing tests and adding ci/cl integration
- Making some meaningful projects using truerandom.js


If you are interested in helping me in any of these create a pull request, create an issue or email me at vk.idk.here@gmail.com

Also if you have an feature in mind then please do tell me.

Anyways this thing is in super development stage so sorry for any errors.
